*Objective:
- Detect customer has high potential default after applying for a loan
- Ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
- Build machine learning models to predict high-risk customer

*Conclusion:
1. Characteristic to decide whether a customer could be a defaulter:
- Customer is low-skill Labourer, avoid sales staff, laborers, driver
- Male is at higher risk than Female
- Customer has lower education level 
- Customer who is civil marriage or single/not married
- Customer who has income range from 0 -200k

- Customer has working experience less than 5 years
2. Characteristic to decide whether a customer could be a good repayer:
- Academic degree (higher education)
- Customer is above 50 year olds
- Customer has income above 300K
- Customer has working experience more than 30 years
**: The main outcome of this analysis is that identifying the most important features to detect the bank loan defaulter and a data analysis guideline for control risk process. The solution is that we can create new useful features to train the models and improve the efficiency.


*Suggestion:
- For those customers who have high risk to be be default, some solutions can be conducted such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. 
- Bank can utilise the variables which are strong indicators of default for their portfolio and risk assessment.
